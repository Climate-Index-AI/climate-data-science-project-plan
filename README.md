# Developing Algorithms for Climate Impact on Asset Pricing Using Research Data

## Project Overview

### Title
Developing Algorithms for Climate Impact on Asset Pricing Using Research Data

### Objective
To develop and encode in Python deterministic and probabilistic algorithms that describe the causal relationship between climate change and asset pricing, using published research papers and associated datasets. The goal is to apply these algorithms to real use cases for commercial real estate assets, securities, and bonds, and generate actionable insights.

### Background
With increasing climate variability, understanding the impact of climate on asset pricing is crucial for investors. This project leverages published research and datasets to create algorithms that can be applied to predict asset pricing based on climate change data.

## Project Scope

### Problem Statement
Climate change has a significant economic impact on commercial real estate (CRE) assets, investment portfolios, and capital markets, but little is yet known about how climate change affects the performance of these assets. This project aims to bridge this knowledge gap by converting research data trails into deterministic and probabilistic algorithms that describe the causal relationship between climate change and asset pricing.

### Deliverables
- **Algorithms Encoded in Python**: Develop and encode deterministic and probabilistic algorithms from each research paper.
- **Documentation of the Algorithms**: Comprehensive documentation detailing the algorithms, their functions, and how they relate to the research.
- **List and Definitions of Dependent and Independent Variables**: Provide a detailed list and definitions of all dependent and independent variables used in each research paper.

## Methodology

### Approach
1. **Algorithm Extraction**: Extract algorithms from each research paper, including mathematical formulas, coefficients, and assumptions.
2. **Data Acquisition**: Gather the necessary datasets identified in the papers to support the algorithm development.
3. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data to match the requirements of the algorithms.
4. **Algorithm Encoding**: Encode the extracted algorithms into Python, ensuring they are functional and accurate.
5. **Validation and Testing**: Validate the algorithms using the provided datasets to ensure they produce the expected results.
6. **Documentation**: Document each algorithm, including the logic, data requirements, and any assumptions made during the encoding process.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Programming Language**: Python

## Project Timeline

The project will proceed one research paper at a time, with each paper being fully analyzed, its data gathered, algorithms developed and tested, and documentation completed before moving on to the next paper.

## Expected Challenges

- Handling missing or inconsistent data.
- Ensuring accuracy and completeness of extracted algorithms.
- Validating algorithms against provided datasets.
- Thoroughly documenting complex methodologies and assumptions.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Accuracy**: Algorithms must produce correct and reliable results.
- **Completeness**: All relevant aspects of the research paper must be encoded.
- **Clarity**: Documentation should be clear, comprehensive, and easy to follow.
- **Usability**: Algorithms should be practical and applicable to real-world use cases.
